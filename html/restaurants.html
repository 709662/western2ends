          <h2>De Foodhallen</h2>
          <p>
            One of my favorites. I just don’t shut up about it. My only issue is
            that it is popular. Get to de Foodhallen early for lunch or dinner
            so you can find a seat. With 21 different food & drink stalls
            including a beer bar, a Gin & Tonic bar, and a “regular” bar, there
            is definitely something for everyone. I can’t really list my
            favorites because it would basically be the whole place. What I will
            say is that you should get bitterballen if you haven’t had it yet
            and a Gin & Tonic because I consider it an Amsterdam drink. For
            reference, you can get fancy hot dogs, Iberian ham, Vietnamese
            goodness, pizza, burgers, a massive meat plate, and a lot of veggie
            options (plus much more).

          <h2>Rotisserie</h2>
          <p>
            Obsessed. When we lived in the west, we would walk here all the
            time. Someone wants to meet up? Cool, meet us at Rotisserie. It is
            that good. Get the chicken, get a burger, get whatever. It’s gonna
            be great! I suggest reservations if possible, but try to get there.
            They use quality ingredients and everything (actually everything,
            including buns, pickles, and sauces) is homemade. You’ll leave
            feeling fully satisfied!

          <h2>Vegan Junk Food Bar (Westside)</h2>
          <p>
            No meat Monday? Vegan? Vegetarian? Maybe you just want to see what a
            vegan junk food bar looks and tastes like. I’ll admit, I was
            surprised. Everything was super tasty. I’m not vegan, but was
            curious. I believe that we can all like vegan meals, have vegan
            snacks, and not miss the meat a couple times a week. So, yeah, I’ll
            recommend this place! Besides, it’s funky and great for photos, too!

          <h2>Mussels & Gin</h2>
          <p>
            If you’re in the Westerpark area, you may want to check out Mussels
            & Gin. We’ve been a couple times and it’s always delish. A gin &
            tonic is a must here. Don’t argue (unless you just don’t drink, then
            you go on doing you). Just get one from the nice list they have. And
            get mussels and fries. If it’s a nice day, sit in the garden! Just
            be aware that it is in the middle of a very green area, so bugs are
            a real thing. No worries though. There’s an inside restaurant, too.
            Oh, and they have their own gin mayo–a must with the fries.
